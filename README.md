# Data Analysis of Lalonde
Both files are extensions of the prominent work of shown in LaLonde, R. J. (1986). Evaluating the econometric evaluations of training programs with experimental data. The American economic review, 604-620.

The file on **Machine Learning Applications** compares a simple difference-in-means estimate of the treatment effect with robust applications of multivariate regressions and random forests. The analysis is complemented by an application of Fisher's Exact Test to derive assumptions-free confidence intervals.

**Matching Analysis** shows the implementation of several matching methods on the same questions, starting with the basic estimation based on propensity score matching, applying multivariate matching, and showing finally the superior results of parametrically-optimized version  of genetic matching. I include entropy balancing for comparison purposes of prominent statistical methodologies.
